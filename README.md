Game genre: collecting game.

Game description: you are a lifeguard who needs to collect barrels of fuel from the water to stay on duty as long as possible.

The main character: the rescue ship.

Game Objective: The objective of the game is to collect as many barrels as possible to set your personal best.

Gameplay features: the ship has a constant life subtraction, if the life drops to zero, the player loses. To replenish life, the player must collect barrels that appear at a random distance from the player. Each barrel collected gives the player 1 point. The total number of points collected is visible on the HUD, and this parameter is indicated by an asterisk, or the player receives statistics on the points collected after losing. I tried to realize a realistic simulation of water and objects on it to make the game look realistic. The game also includes a main menu, a pause menu and a lose menu.

Platforms: PC.

Control: the ship is controlled by the W, A, S, D keys; the camera is controlled by the mouse and the zoom in / out roller.
